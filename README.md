# World_Weather_Analysis
## Summary
In this project, we will be performing the following tasks:
- Use OpenWeather API to gather the weather data for cities based on a randomly generated set of latitude/longitude coordinates. 
- Use the Google Maps API to identify the closest hotels to these city locations and retrieve the hotel names. The markers will be plotted on a Google Maps figure.
- Choose a subset of four hotels and add a Directions layer mapping the travel route between these locations on a Google Maps figure.
- Create a map with markers detailing information about each hotel location.
